# RemoteIronManHelmet
 For using a esp01s as a remote to my other esp01s iron man helmet project

This code is completely written by ChatGPT

I found it to be a funny idea after seeing a couple of videos of it online. Wanted to check it out by myself.
Since its a pretty simple code and I just wrote the one for the server I figured it could be funny to test out.

Included in the ChatGPT folder is screenshots of most of the conversation as well as the different code snippets in order as they were replied.

Code compiles without error but I have not tested it yet.
